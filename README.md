# favorite-modules

My favorite node modules with a very brief explanation of the intent or use case.

#### [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#readme)

Colors and styling for the terminal.

#### [`rc`](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc)

Dominic has solved the configuration problem once and for all. Provide default values for your config and override using command line arguments and/or configuration files and/or environment variables. Support for `.json` and `.ini` formats.

#### [`safe-buffer`](https://github.com/feross/safe-buffer)

A safer node.js Buffer API. Works in the browser.

#### [`sodium-universal`](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-universal)

Need crypto? Want it to work in both node and in the browser? For the node case, there are prebuilt binaries for all major OS. If prebuilt fails, then falls back to pure js. Backed by [f`libsodium`](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

#### [`standard`](https://github.com/feross/standard)

A JavaScript coding style. Just embrace it, get rid of all bike shedding and move on to more important stuff.
